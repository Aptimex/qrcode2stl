# qrcode2stl

Create QR codes and download them as \*.stl file for 3d printing.

Modified to remove the unecessary wait times that were injected for displaying ads, so you don't have to deal with that when hosting this yourself. 

Updated working Docker code thanks to @savvyaxl. 

## Project setup
```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```

Server will be accessible on port 8082.
